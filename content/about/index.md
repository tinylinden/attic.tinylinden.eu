> **Attic** noun, /ˈætɪk/: A room at the top of a house under the roof.

In Poland, we use attics to store things that may come in handy someday.
So welcome, wanderer, to my attic cluttered with notes addressed mainly
to me from the future, but perhaps useful to you as well. Most of them
are descriptions of software solutions that seemed to me quite neat and
elegant. Some are probably an unsuccessful attempt to write down concepts
that seem interesting to me.
